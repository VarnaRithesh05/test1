This feature has three parts: the Frontend (HTML), the Backend (Python), and the Connector (JavaScript).

1. Prompt for the Frontend (HTML)
Give this to Replit AI to add the components to your index.html.

"In my index.html file, inside the section for the 'YML File Analyzer', add the following HTML elements:

A file input that only accepts .yml or .yaml files.

A 'Submit' button with the ID analyze-button.

A container that holds two side-by-side <div> blocks.

Give the left one the ID original-code (for the bad code).

Give the right one the ID corrected-code (for the good code).

A <div> at the bottom with the ID explanation-box."

2. Prompt for the Backend (Python)
Give this to Replit AI to add the "brain" to your main.py file.

"In my main.py file:

Install and import the google-generativeai library.

Add a new Flask route /analyze-yml that accepts 'POST' requests.

Inside this route, get the uploaded file from the request.

Read the file's content into a string.

Configure a Gemini API client (tell me to set the API key in Replit Secrets).

Send the file's content to the Gemini API with this exact prompt: 'You are an expert DevOps engineer. The following is a YAML file. Analyze it for errors, misconfigurations, and bad practices. Respond ONLY with a single JSON object with three keys: 1. corrected_yaml (the full corrected YAML file), 2. explanation (a detailed, step-by-step explanation of what was wrong and why you fixed it), and 3. is_correct (a boolean).'

Return the AI's JSON response from this endpoint."

3. Prompt for the Connector (JavaScript)
Give this to Replit AI to create your script.js file and link it to your HTML.

"1. Create a script.js file and link it to my index.html. 2. In script.js, add an event listener to the analyze-button. 3. When clicked, it must: a. Get the file from the file input. b. Use FormData to send this file via a fetch 'POST' request to my /analyze-yml endpoint. c. When the JSON response comes back, put the original-code in the original-code div. d. Put the corrected_yaml string into the corrected-code div. e. Put the explanation string into the explanation-box div. 4. Suggest a JavaScript library (like diff.js) to compare the text in original-code and corrected-code and show the differences in red and green."
